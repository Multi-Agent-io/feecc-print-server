# Feecc Print Server

Feecc Print Server is a microservice, designed to handle printing labels using a Brother QL-series label printer.

It provides a simple REST API interface to print and annotate images. It also handles user authentication.

Feecc Print Server comes as a part of the Feecc, a Web3 enabled production tracking system.

Print Server is a microservice that is written in asynchronous Python using FastAPI framework and relies on [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to annotate images.

## Deployment

The app is supposed to be run in a Docker container and can be configured by setting several environment variables.

> Note, that we assume a Linux host in this guide, however you can also run Print Server on any other OS, but be warned: timezone is defined by mounting host `/etc/timezone` and `/etc/localtime` files inside the container, which are not present on Windows machines, so you might end up with UTC time inside your container.

Start by cloning the git repository onto your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-print-server.git
```

Enter the app directory and modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to your needs by changing the environment variables (discussed in the configuration part).

```
cd feecc-print-server
vim docker-compose.yml
```

When you are done configuring your installation, build and start the container using docker-compose:
```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

Verify your deployment by going to http://127.0.0.1:8083/docs in your browser. You should see the SwaggerUI API
specification page. Continue from there.

## Configuration

To configure your Print Server deployment edit the environment variables, provided in `docker-compose.yml` file.

Environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI` — your MongoDB connection URI ending with `/db-name`
- `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` — leave null if you want testing credentials to work, otherwise set it to `true`
- `PAPER_WIDTH` — paper width in mm
- `PRINTER_MODEL` — label printer model name
- `RED` — whether the black and red paper is loaded or not (boolean, null for false)
